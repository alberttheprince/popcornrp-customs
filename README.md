Popcornrp-Customs was created following the subsequent discovery of QB-Customs containing stolen/leaked code. Popcornrp-Customs is a total replacement for QB-Customs and is fully compatible with QB-Garages. However, Popcornrp-Customs only depends on ox_lib and can be used with any framework.

Find Ox_lib Here: https://github.com/overextended/ox_lib

This uses dragcam (already part of this resource) from Jorn:  https://github.com/Jorn08/dragcam

To use this resource, install ox_lib and this resource and ensure Popcornrp-Customs after ox_lib. All car customization locations can be set in the config.lua file.

You are free to modify this resource as per the attached license. **Please read and understand the license**, as it is a slightly modified MIT License.

This resource is released with no support or promise of support. It is released as is, and we may make changes as we see fit. You may suggest changes, but we will only add or develop them if we see a need for that function for our server Popcorn Roleplay. We have thoroughly tested this resource with our small community, but feel free to report any issues that may arise.

Thank you, and enjoy!
