# popcornrp-customs
A free-to-use and modify vehicle customization for FiveM using ox-lib

This release is a thank you to the FiveM open-source community and all the developers who have poured hours of their free time into creating helpful, free resources that I've used on my servers in the past and continue to use. Thank you!

Popcornrp-Customs was created following the subsequent discovery of QB-Customs containing stolen/leaked code. Popcornrp-Customs is a total replacement for QB-Customs and is fully compatible with QB-Garages. However, Popcornrp-Customs only depends on ox_lib and can be used with any framework.

Find Ox_lib Here: https://github.com/overextended/ox_lib

To use this resource, install ox_lib and this resource and ensure Popcornrp-Customs after ox_lib. All car customization locations can be set in the config.lua file.

Popcornrp-Customs allows you to set up the following:

- Free EMS and Police Customization
- Disable or Enable customization options
- Change pricing
- Drag your camera and zoom in and out
- Air wrench sound to confirm the customization
- Displayed pricing
- All tire and paint options (including Chameleon)
- Customize your car (duh)

You are free to modify this license as per the attached license. **Please read and understand the license**, as it is a slightly modified MIT License.

This resource is released with no support or promise of support. It is released as is, and we may make changes as we see fit. You may suggest changes, but we won't add or develop them unless we see a need for that function for our server Popcorn Roleplay. We have thoroughly tested this resource with our small community, but feel free to report any issues that may arise.

Thank you, and enjoy!
